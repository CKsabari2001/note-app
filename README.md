# Note Verse

Welcome to the Note Verse! This React-based application provides a simple and efficient way to manage your notes with features like note creation, editing, deletion, and a stylish dark mode theme.

## Key Features

### 1. Create Notes with Word Limitation

Effortlessly jot down your thoughts and ideas. The app allows you to create new notes, providing you with a blank canvas to capture your important information. Please note that there is a word limitation of 200 words per note to encourage concise and focused note-taking.

### 2. Edit and Update

Easily edit and update existing notes. Whether it's a minor tweak or a substantial revision, the editing feature ensures your notes remain up to date.

### 3. Delete Notes

Swiftly delete notes that have served their purpose or are no longer relevant. The app's delete functionality provides a seamless way to declutter your notes while maintaining a tidy workspace.

### 4. Dark Mode Theme

Our Note Verse comes with a stylish dark mode theme for enhanced visual comfort during extended usage and a touch of modern aesthetics to your note-taking experience.

### 5. Timestamped Notes

Every note you create is automatically timestamped with the date of creation. This feature helps you keep track of when each note was written, ensuring your notes are organized by date.

### 6. Persistent Storage

Worried about losing your valuable notes? Our app uses local storage to persistently store your notes on your device. Please be aware that if you clear your browser data or switch to a different browser, the stored notes may not be accessible.
